# Jewel-Thief-Game

## Introduction 
The game, “The Jewel Thief” consists of a series of brick-steps which the player (thief) has to climb. If the player drops, the game comes to an end. It is a single player game and 10 points are awarded for every step jumped.
This game has no fixed levels, and will only stop when the player misses to jump on the brick step.
This game has been developed on Python platform using Pygame libraries.

## Platform: PYTHON

Game development in python is an easier task as compared to doing the same in Java or C++. Python has libraries like Tkinter, Pygame and PyOpenGl which help a lot in this process. 

Pygame library of Python is exclusively dedicated for game development and one  can initially explore its GUI related things. One can try to model 3D using 2D graphics and make simple games using images and simple rendering . After that when you come up with a logic of 3D game , you should learn PyOpenGL because its one of the most awesome libraries for 3D. 

A major advantage of using Python for game development is that the language is very easy to learn

a)	Background music
b)	Making a counter for ‘High Score”.
c)	Making an option for single player and multi-player.
d)	Increase obstacles and vary number of levels.

## Run Code
To run the code, run file game.py

## Conclusion

The game “The Jewel Thief” was developed on Python using the graphics libraries.
The game has scope of improvement in terms of inclusion of background music, increase in number of player per time.
